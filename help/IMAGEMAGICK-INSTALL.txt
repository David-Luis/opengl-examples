IMPORTANT: This software works with ImageMagick 6. ImageMagick 7 was
released in 2016 with a few incompatible changes. Version 6 is still
installed on most machines and there are plans to support it for at
least 10 years. Until version 7 is available on more machines, we will
focus on making sure opengl-examples works well with version 6.

If you want to try ImageMagick 7, you will at least need to change one
#include at the top of lib/imageio.h.

== Ubuntu instructions ==

On Ubuntu, try installing the following two packages (and the
packages that they depend on):
imagemagick
libmagickcore-dev


== Mac OS X - Homebrew instructions ==

Install imagemagick and ensure that ghostscript support is
enabled. Ghostscript support is necessary to support using imagemagick
to render text onto textures. Run the following command:

brew install imagemagick --with-ghostscript

Verify that ghostscript support is enabled with:

brew info imagemagick

Verify that imagemagick has access to fonts by running:

convert -list font

If fonts are not available, then follow these instructions:

== Compiling form source ==

If you need to compile ImageMagick yourself:

1) Download the ImageMagick source file and extract the files

2) cd into the ImageMagick directory.

3) Run "./configure"

4) If configure fails, it will probably complain about one or more
missing libraries. Install those libraries and try running configure
again.

5) Run "make"

6a) If you are administrator and want to install the library into
/usr/local/ on your system, run "sudo make install"

6b) If you aren't administrator and/or don't want to install the
library onto your system, open CMakeLists.txt. Look for where
CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH and CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH are set in the area of the
file that involves ImageMagick. You can add additional lines to tell
cmake where your copy of ImageMagick is installed.
