ASSIMP is available in the Ubuntu package manager, OS X homebrew, and
many other package managers. Version 3.1.1 or higher is recommended
(versions prior to 3.1.1 may scale some models incorrectly). On many
systems, you will need to install both the library and the associated
headers (for example libassimp3 and libassimp-dev).

To compile it yourself, download a copy:
http://assimp.sourceforge.net/

Run "cmake ."
Run "make"
Run "make install" to install files into /usr/local

If you encounter problems compiling assimp 3.2, try changing "cmake ."
to "cmake -DASSIMP_BUILD_TESTS=OFF ."

To make sure that cmake finds your copy of the library, run
"./cleanup.sh" to clean up all of the binaries and CMake cache files
from your opengl-examples directory. Then run "cmake ." and "make" to
compile with ASSIMP.
