You can find ASSIMP at: https://github.com/assimp/assimp/releases

--- SELECTING AN ASSIMP VERSION ---

If you want to use ASSIMP you should use the following versions: 
   
   - 3.0 or higher should work (but it has a problem where some models
     are scaled incorrectly when loaded)

   - 3.1.1 or 3.2 is recommended

   - 3.3 or 3.3.1 should also work but hasn't been tested as heavily.



--- LINUX INSTRUCTIONS ---

First try installing ASSIMP via your distributions package manager. On
many systems, you will need to install both the library and the
associated headers (for example libassimp3 and libassimp-dev).

If you decide to compile it yourself:
Download it from the website listed above
Extract files
cmake .
make

If you encounter problems compiling assimp 3.2, try changing "cmake ."
to "cmake -DASSIMP_BUILD_TESTS=OFF ."

Next, use one of the following two options:
 1) Run "sudo make install" to install ASSIMP into /usr/local
 2) Edit opengl-examples/CMakeModules/FindASSIMP.txt so that this software can find your copy of the library.


--- OSX INSTRUCTIONS ---

Install homebrew and run "brew install assimp"


--- WINDOWS INSTRUCTIONS ---

Download ASSIMP source code (we've tested with ASSIMP 3.2). Ensure that you have CMake and Visual Studio installed.

Run cmake-gui

Set the root directory of the ASSIMP source code to be "where is the source code:" and "where to build the binaries:".

Click "Configure". Select Visual Studio and native compilers.

Click "Generate".

Open "Assimp.sln" with Visual Studio.

Right click on the ALL_BUILD solution and select "Build"

Refer back to WINDOWS-VisualStudio.txt to get opengl-examples to work with your library.
