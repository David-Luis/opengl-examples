=== How do I get a copy of ASSIMP? ===

Linux: Use built-in package manager. Install both the library and the
development files (i.e., install libassimp3 and libassimp-dev
packages---although they might have different names on your
system). If it isn't available in your package manager, download and
compile ASSIMP yourself.

OS X: Use homebrew.

Windows: Download and compile it yourself. 

=== Where can I download the ASSIMP source code? ===

Visit: https://github.com/assimp/assimp/releases


=== Which version of ASSIMP do I need? ===

We recommend 3.1.1 or higher. We have not found any problems with
using ASSIMP 3.2. Initial testing indicates that ASSIMP 3.3 and 3.3.1
works too.


=== Compiling ASSIMP from source on Linux ===

Download the ASSIMP source code (see above).

Run "cmake ."
Run "make"
Run "make install" to install files into /usr/local

If you encounter problems compiling assimp 3.2, try changing "cmake ."
to "cmake -DASSIMP_BUILD_TESTS=OFF ."

To make sure that the opengl-examples cmake finds your copy of the
library, run "./cleanup.sh" to clean up all of the binaries and CMake
cache files from your opengl-examples directory. Then run "cmake ."
and "make" to compile with ASSIMP.
