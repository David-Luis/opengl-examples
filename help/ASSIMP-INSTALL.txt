--- LOCATION ---

You can find ASSIMP at: https://github.com/assimp/assimp/releases

--- SELECTING AN ASSIMP VERSION ---

If you want to use ASSIMP you should use the following versions: 
   
   - 3.0 or higher should work (but it has a problem where some models
     are scaled incorrectly when loaded)

   - 3.1.1 or 3.2 is recommended


--- USING ASSIMP WITH THIS CODE ---

To make sure that cmake finds your copy of the library, run
"./cleanup.sh" to clean up all of the binaries and CMake cache files
from your opengl-examples directory. Then run "cmake ." and "make" to
compile with ASSIMP. If CMake doesn't find your copy of the ASSIMP
library, you may need to edit CMakeModules/FindASSIMP.cmake.


--- LINUX INSTRUCTIONS ---

First try installing ASSIMP via your distributions package manager. On
many systems, you will need to install both the library and the
associated headers (for example libassimp3 and libassimp-dev).

If you decide to compile it yourself:
Download it from the website listed above
Extract files
cmake .
make
make install     # will install files into /usr/local


--- OSX INSTRUCTIONS ---

Install homebrew and run "brew install assimp"


--- WINDOWS INSTRUCTIONS ---

Download ASSIMP source code. Ensure that you have CMake and Visual Studio installed.

Run cmake-gui

Set the root directory of the ASSIMP source code to be "where is the source code:" and "where to build the binaries:".

Click "Configure". Select Visual Studio and native compilers.

Click "Generate".

Open "Assimp.sln" with Visual Studio.

Right click on the ALL_BUILD solution and select "Build"
