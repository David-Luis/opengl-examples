This instruction is for installation of VRPN on opengl-example windows branch.

1. First, download the VRPN at: https://github.com/vrpn/vrpn
   Then, download the hidapi at: https://github.com/signal11/hidapi, and put the "windows" folder of the hidapi into the /submodules/hidapi of the VRPN folder.

2. Use CMake gui to generate the ".sln" file for use of visual studio. Set the src directory to be the VRPN folder. Create a subfolder "build" in VRPN folder, and set it as the target directory. Then configue and generate.
Note: VRPN provided a .sln file, but I had problem when I use their file. So here I recommend to use CMake to generate it again.

3. Open the vrpn.sln in /build/ that's generated by CMake, using visual studio (recommend VisualStudio 2015).
Find project named "test-vrpn" and build it. This will build vrpn, quat, vrpn-server, etc. 

4. Go back to the opengl-example solution, and find project named: "kuhl". Right click the project, in properties->C/C++->General->Additional Include Directories, and add the directories that contains the vrpnd.h, vrpnserverd.h, and quatd.h.

5. Now go to the project that you want to use. For example: "viewer.cpp". Right click the project, then go to properties->Linker->Input->Additional Dependencies, and add the library files: vrpn.lib, vrpnserver.lib, and quat.lib. 

6. Now you can build the project, for instance viewer. You might find some symbol errors. In that case, go to vrpn-help.c and delete the "ifdef" and "ifndef" to force the program load vrpn header files.
