=== Linux installation ===

On recent Ubuntu installations (16.04, for example), you can install
GLFW3 by installing the libglfw3 and libglfw3-dev packages.


=== Mac OS X installation ===

Install glfw via homebrew.


=== Compiling GLFW yourself ===

If none of the options above work for you, you can download and compile GLFW yourself.

Download the source for GLFW: http://www.glfw.org/download.html

Unzip the source code.

Make sure cmake is installed.

Run "cmake ." to create makefiles

Run "make" to compile the library

Next, use one of the following two options:
 1) Run "sudo make install" to install GLFW into /usr/local/include/GLFW and /usr/local/lib
 2) In CMakeLists.txt for the example OpenGL programs included in this package, set the glfw_src_path variable to the path to the GLFW source.
