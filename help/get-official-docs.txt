To get OpenGL 4.0 docs, run:

svn co --username anonymous --password anonymous https://cvs.khronos.org/svn/repos/ogl/trunk/ecosystem/public/sdk/docs/man4/ man4/
cd man4/

There are several different ways you could process the xml files found in that repository. Some documentation is available here: https://www.opengl.org/wiki/Getting_started/XML_Toolchain_and_Man_Pages

I have used the following procedure to create a PDF containing the documentation for OpenGL C functions, and also create a PDF containing GLSL function/variable documentation. To do this, you will need to make sure you are using the "bash" shell. Then follow these steps:

for i in *.xml; do dblatex $i; done

# wait a while!

# Assemble individual PDFs into a single OpenGL PDF:
pdftk gl[^_]*.pdf cat output ~/ogl4-doc.pdf
rm gl[^_]*.pdf 

# All remaining PDFs should be related to GLSL:
pdftk *.pdf output ~/ogl4-glsl-doc.pdf

You will find the two resulting PDFs in your home directory.
