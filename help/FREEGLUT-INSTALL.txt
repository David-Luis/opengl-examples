--- SELECTING A FREEGLUT VERSION ---

This code works with most recent versions of freeglut including 3.0.0
and recent 2.x.x releases.


--- USING FREEGLUT WITH THIS CODE ---

To make sure that cmake finds your copy of the library, run
"./cleanup.sh" to clean up all of the binaries and CMake cache files
from your opengl-examples directory. Then run "cmake ." and "make" to
compile with Freeglut. If CMake doesn't find your copy of the Freeglut
library, you may need to edit CMakeModules/FindGLUT.cmake.



--- LINUX INSTRUCTIONS ---

Freeglut is available in package managers for many Linux
distributions. Even if you have freeglut installed, cmake may require
that you also have some X development libraries installed too.

For example, on Ubuntu 14.04, you may need to install these packages:
libxmu-dev
libxi-dev
freeglut3-dev


To compile freeglut from scratch, download the latest version from:
freeglut.sf.net
tar -xzf freeglut-X.X.X.tar.gz
cd freeglut-X-X-X
cmake .
make

If you also want to install the program onto your system:
make install


--- OSX INSTRUCTIONS ---

On OSX, the glut included with XCode should be sufficient.


--- WINDOWS INSTRUCTIONS ---

Download Freeglut source code (we've tested with Freeglut 3.0.0). Ensure that you have CMake and Visual Studio installed.

Run cmake-gui

Set the root directory of the Freeglut source code to be "where is the source code:" and "where to build the binaries:".

Click "Configure". Select Visual Studio and native compilers.

Click "Generate".

Open "freeglut.sln" with Visual Studio.

Right click on the ALL_BUILD solution and select "Build"

Refer back to WINDOWS-VisualStudio.txt to get opengl-examples to work with your library.
