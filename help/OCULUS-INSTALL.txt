Linux support for Oculus Rift is still considered experimental, and must be
compiled from source. You will need to be on a computer that you have root
access to.
 
Installation:
1. Download the Linux Oculus SDK from https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/
2. Extract the contents using "tar -xf ovr_sdk_linux*.tar.xz"
3. Run "sudo ./ConfigureDebian.sh"
4. Run "make"

NOTE: Before using any applications that require an Oculus Rift, you MUST run
      the Oculus Rift daemon (oculusd). 
      To do so, run "./oculusd"

Oculus Configuration:
1. Make sure oculusd is running.
2. Run "cd ConfigUtil"
3. Run "./RiftConfigUtil"
4. If it gives an error message, you may need to modify permissions of the 
   Resources directory and its contents before being able to run the utility.
