--- GETTING STARTED ---

STEP 0: Install Visual Studio (we have verified that it works with
Visual Studio Community 2015). You will also need to install cmake for
Windows. Finally, you may also want to install git to interact with
the opengl-examples git repository.

STEP 1: You will first need to download several libraries that opengl-examples
depends on. We recommend that you place the source code and the
libraries that you compile into a single folder (for example, an
"opengl-libs" folder on your desktop, right next to your
"opengl-examples" code also on your desktop).

STEP 2: Download and compile each of the following
libraries. Instructions for obtaining and compiling these libraries
are available in separate text files in this directory.

 - ASSIMP
 - GLFW
 - Glew
 - VRPN - Optional, skip it if you don't need it.

STEP 2: Open the cmake-gui app. Set the "Where is the source code" and
"Where to build the binaries" to be your opengl-examples folder. If
you have previously completed this step but are getting unusual
results, first go to "File" and click "Delete cache". Next, click
"Configure", proceed with the default 32-bit build (64-bit hasn't
been tested). If there are any obvious error messages relating to the
three libraries above, attempt to fix them. If the libraries are not
being found, look at the top of the cmake output to see a listing of
different directories where cmake is trying to find your libraries and
make sure that everything looks OK. Once everything is properly
configured, press "Generate".

STEP 3: Open opengl-examples.sln in Visual Studio. Try building the
"triangle" program (a simple program that doesn't depend on ASSIMP)
and the "viewer" program (a program that does depend on assimp).

STEP 4: Look for the programs you built in
opengl-examples/bin/Debug. But, before you try to run them, you will
need to copy assimp-vc???-mtd.dll and glew32.dll into the bin/Debug
folder too! You can find the dll files in the bin folders inside of
the source code for the corresponding libraries.

 - Get the code to work with ImageMagick
